    <h1>How we choose the slaughterhouse</h1>

    <h2>Most people aren’t trapped. They’re comfortable. And that’s what makes it so terrifying. We’d rather be accepted in a lie than rejected in the truth. </h2>
    <p>I used to say it half jokingly: “People are cattle.”</p>
    <p>It started as a kind of shorthand for what I saw everywhere. Crowds following trends, beliefs, politicians, ideologies, without so much as a raised eyebrow. No pause. No question. Just moving in herds. Heads down. Eyes forward.</p>
    <p>I’d toss it out when someone reposted a headline without reading the article. When the office rallied around a new policy no one really understood. When friends seemed more interested in fitting in than speaking up. It was cynical, sure, but it felt true. People are cattle.</p>
    <p>Then one night, I was watching a superhero movie. Not a great one, but it was fun. Easy. Mindless in the best kind of way. Something to unwind with. I was enjoying it, right up until a certain character came on screen.</p>
    <p>She was the villain. And she was clearly modeled after a real person. Someone who, in real life, speaks with conviction and integrity. Someone who challenges the status quo. But someone the media has painted as dangerous. Toxic. A threat to what we’re told is normal. In the movie, she was a caricature. All sharp edges and cold stares. A warning.</p>
    <p>And I couldn’t shake it. That character stayed with me more than the story. She felt planted. Strategic. A quiet way of reinforcing what we’re supposed to believe. And the more I thought about it, the more that old phrase bubbled up.</p>
    <p>People are cattle.</p>
    <p>And suddenly, it didn’t feel clever anymore. It felt honest. And uncomfortable.</p>
    <p>We really are cattle.</p>
    <p>But not just in the way I used to mean it. Not just mindless followers.</p>
    <p>We’re animals that have learned to live inside a fence we could break any time we want, but don’t. We’ve convinced ourselves the meadow is safer. Easier. Familiar.</p>
    <p>We graze on the same ideas. Same distractions. Same comfortable lies. All while the gate stays wide open. And even when we sense the danger ahead, even when we know that something about this path ends in slaughter, we stay. Because it’s what everyone else is doing. Because stepping out would mean stepping alone.</p>
    <p>But there’s something even darker underneath all that. It’s not just about comfort or fear. It’s about ego.</p>
    <p>If our ego believes the path is noble, we’ll follow it straight into the slaughterhouse. We’ll defend the direction with passion. Even pride. All in the hopes of being liked. Being accepted. Being part of the herd. Other people have told us this is what we must do to be liked. All those screaming voices that media platforms and headlines amplify. So we follow. Not just blindly, but willingly.</p>
    <p>That night, that character modeled after someone real was what made me see it all more clearly. How quickly we turn people into villains when they threaten the stories we’ve grown comfortable with. How easily we trade truth for tribe.</p>
    <p>We are the only species that can foresee our own suffering and still walk into it with our eyes wide open. Not because we’re evil. Not because we’re stupid. But because we’ve mistaken comfort for safety. And belonging for truth.</p>
    <p>And the deeper danger is this. Once an idea becomes part of who we are, we’ll defend it long after it stops making sense. That is where ideology takes hold. Where ego overrides evidence. Where being right becomes more important than being real.</p>
    <p>It’s a hard thing to accept. That we might be choosing the pen even when the gate is open. That maybe we’re not captives after all. Just terribly practiced at captivity.</p>
    <p>But if we can admit that, really admit it, there’s a flicker of hope.</p>
    <p>Because the fence is weak. The gate is open. And the slaughterhouse only wins if we keep walking toward it.</p>

I've studied diets, supplements and simply health for decades now, and after going through one promoted thing that, in another venue, is told to give no health benefits I realized something:

Listen to your body.

We are more similar than we are unique, and I do believe there is a correct way of eating for everyone. However, some might handle the bad intake better, and some do it worse. Some might also lack a certain component that other's have naturally. But it all comes down to listening to your body.

If you eat in a certain way, and it makes you feel fantastic - it doesn't matter what science or people around you say. You've found it.

If you got more energy than ever. You've found it.
If you reach the weight your body is comfortable in. You've found it.

With that said, I believe in the following diet:

The common belief today is that we need carbohydrates and that fasting is bad for you. But I beg to differ. Think about it, way back when our forefathers lived, when they had nothing to eat but meat and vegetables. Grains wasn't discovered yet, nor potatoes, pasta or any sort of big carbohydrate intake that we have today.

If they absolutely needed carbohydrates - we wouldn't exist today. You wouldn't exist today. The same goes for fasting, they didn't eat perfect meals every day, there was days of no food, yet they found the strength to hunt and survive.

If fasting and no carbohydrates would diminish their strength, eventually they wouldn't have survived. Plus, the body isn't that dumb to lessen the strength of itself when times are rough. Makes sense to me that it strengthens itself instead, to increase the chances for survival.

There's one thing I add - probiotica. This is to increase the healthy bacteria in gut. My microbiome.

That's why I only eat meat and vegetables, fast between 20:00 to 12:00 (ie, skipping breakfast) and I don't eat any sources rich in carbohydrates.

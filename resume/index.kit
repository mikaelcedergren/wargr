      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p><q>The true measure of design lies in its ability to blend clarity and beauty with a distinct purpose — its worth proven only by the results it brings.</q>Over the years, I've worked across all forms of media, honing my skills in design, marketing, and leadership. My deep understanding of what needs to be communicated — and why — allows me to shape experiences that truly connect with audiences.</p>
      <p>With hands-on experience in graphic design and creative leadership, I've been the crucial bridge between stakeholders and developers. I understand both sides of the process intimately, leveraging my design expertise alongside my development insight to guide projects from concept to completion. Whether in hands-on design or leading creative teams, what motivates me most — and where I bring the most value — is in the act of creating. Accessibility is also a key priority for me, ensuring that every design is not only beautiful but also functional for all users.</p>
      <p>In short, I firmly believe the true measure of design lies in its ability to blend clarity and beauty with a distinct purpose — its worth proven only by the results it brings. With a smile and a positive spirit, I transform bold ideas into impactful designs that simply get the job done.</p>

      <h1>Selected Projects</h1>
      <pre>YouCruit Growth Hack Email</pre>
      <p>Created an email campaign that matched job applicants with employers from a parsed database. Designed the messaging and structure, resulting in a 13%+ conversion rate — far exceeding industry standards — and new customer sign-ups roughly every 5 seconds for several months.</p>
      <pre>Lanefinder Job Application UX Flow</pre>
      <p>Using common practices for trucking job applications on the Lanefinder app and website resulted in very few responses. I overhauled the UI/UX by introducing a pre-screening feature that provided employers with key details upfront, followed by emails and notifications to gather more profile data. This led to a massive spike in applications, growing from just a handful to thousands each month.</p>
      <pre>Lanefinder Component Library</pre>
      <p>Designed and built a complete component library in Figma, then implemented it in TypeScript and Vue. The library was synced across design, development, and marketing, significantly boosting development speed, enhancing visual consistency, and substantially improving efficiency across all departments.</p>
      <pre>Trialbee UI/UX Advertising Enhancements</pre>
      <p>Led a major redesign of advertising landing pages for Trialbee's recruitment campaigns, optimizing them for higher conversions. The new UI/UX framework increased volunteer enrollment rates for clinical trials, enhancing the brand's reach and results.</p>
      <pre>Sveriges Television Motion Graphics</pre>
      <p>Designed the branding and motion graphics for the popular Swedish SVT show 'På Spåret'. The visual style became iconic, and even with changes over the years and other artists involved, my original concept still remains. </p>
      <pre>YouCruit & Lanefinder UI/UX</pre>
      <p>Designed user-focused UI/UX for all Lanefinder and YouCruit platforms, earning high praise in multiple target group surveys.</p>

      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>For over 25 years, I’ve specialized in Art Direction, Brand Design, Graphic Design, and User Experience Design - transforming ideas into impactful, real-world solutions across TV, business, and digital platforms .</p>
      <p>I create brands and products that work together as a cohesive whole, combining clear messaging, strong visuals, intuitive interfaces, and user-friendly experiences. Every piece fits into a consistent bigger picture, earning trust and leaving a lasting impression.</p>
      <p>To me, design is clarity. It’s not about decoration - it’s about solving problems, delivering results, and focusing on the user journey at every step. </p>
      <p>In short, I turn bold ideas into designs that work.</p>
    </section>

      <h1>Selected Projects</h1>
      <pre>YouCruit Growth Hack Email</pre>
      <p>Designed and executed an email campaign that matched job applicants with employers using a parsed database. By combining thoughtful design with compelling messaging, I achieved a 13%+ conversion rate — significantly surpassing the industry standard of around 2%. This resulted in new customer sign-ups for YouCruit roughly every 5 seconds, sustained over several months.</p>
      <pre>Lanefinder Job Application UX Flow</pre>
      <p>Using common practices for trucking job applications on the Lanefinder app and website resulted in very few responses. I overhauled the UI/UX by introducing a pre-screening feature that provided employers with key details upfront, followed by emails and notifications to gather more profile data. This led to a massive spike in applications, growing from just a few to thousands each month.</p>
      <pre>Lanefinder Figma, Marketing and Vue.js Component Library</pre>
      <p>Designed and built a complete component library in Figma, then implemented it in TypeScript and Vue. The library was synced across design, development, and marketing, significantly boosting development speed, enhancing visual consistency, and substantially improving efficiency across all departments.</p>
      <pre>Sveriges Television 'På Spåret'</pre>
      <p>Designed the branding and motion graphics for the popular Swedish SVT show 'På Spåret'. The visual style became iconic, and even with changes over the years and other artists involved, my original concept still remains. </p>
      <pre>YouCruit & Lanefinder UI/UX</pre>
      <p>Designed user-focused UI/UX for all Lanefinder and YouCruit platforms, earning high praise in multiple target group surveys.</p>
      <pre>Faunapoolen Search Engine Optimization</pre>
      <p>Did SEO for Faunapoolen and got the website to the first page of Google for two important searches in just one month by improving keywords, optimizing content, and refining the code.</p>
      <pre>Sixty Cards</pre>
      <p>Built an entire Magic: The Gathering community platform from the ground up, independently using WordPress. Designed and developed the site to allow players to showcase their decks to the world, attracting over 2,000 users in just two months through highly targeted and effective marketing strategies.</p>

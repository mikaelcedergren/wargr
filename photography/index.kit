  <h1>Landscape</h1>
  <p
    >Landscape photography holds a special place in my heart. It has a way of
    reminding me of my insignificance in the grand scheme of things. It puts
    into perspective how trivial our problems can be and shows me that I am but
    a small part of a greater whole. What captivates me even more is capturing
    the beauty that often goes unnoticed by others. It's about immortalizing
    moments that most people simply pass by without a second glance.</p

  <h1>Kids</h1>
  <p
    >Kids are unpredictable, and that creates a welcomed challenge in photographing them.
    Anything can happen, and I love how they contribute to the shoot simply by
    being who they are.</p

  <h1>Wedding</h1>
  <p>Wedding is not my focus, but it is has been an exquisit opportunity to show my style, and I happened to be featured in several wedding blogs - a humbling, yet flattering, experience for sure.</p>

  <h1>Candid Portraits</h1>
  <p
    >Photography is a genuine passion of mine, especially when it comes to capturing portraits. I love how a single moment can reflect someone's true essence, frozen in time by the photographer's skillful anticipation. I particularly enjoy the spontaneity of candid shots and staying agile on my feet to capture those authentic moments.</p

  <h1>Sports</h1>
  <p
    >This was a one time thing photographing a boxing match. And to be
    completely honest, I was bored. There was no drama, nothing of interest,
    but suddenly one of the matches went intense - I grabbed my camera and
    started shooting and thoroughly enjoy every bit of it.</p

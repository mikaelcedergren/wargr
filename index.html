        <h3>Politics — something doesn’t add up</h3>
        <p>Politics sounds complicated, but it rests on one line. The individual on one end, the collective on the other. Both promise fairness, safety, and progress. Yet history shows the story is not as simple as we were taught. </p>

        <h3>The strange mercy of death</h3>
        <p>We spend our lives running from death, as if fear itself could keep it away. I did too, until illness, loss, and grief forced me to face it head on. What I found was not only terror, but something unexpected. A quiet kind of mercy hidden inside the very thing I dreaded most.</p>
